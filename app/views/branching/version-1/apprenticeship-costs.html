			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
				Funding your apprentice:
			</h2>

			<p>
				You can get help from the government to pay for apprenticeship training.
			</p>

			<p>
				The amount you get depends on whether you pay the apprenticeship levy or not. You pay the levy if you’re an employer with a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pay-apprenticeship-levy">pay bill over £3 million each year</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Additional payments of £1,000 may be available to you and your training provider.  For example, when you take on an apprentice who’s between:
			</p>

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>
					16-18 years old
				</li>
				<li>
					19-24 years old and has previously been in care or who has a local authority education, health and care plan
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				From August 2018, apprentices will receive a one off payment of £1000 from the government, if they have been in the care of the local authority.
			</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
				Paying for your apprentices using a transfer of funds from another employer
			</h2>

			<p>
				If you’re an employer who’s received a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transferring-apprenticeship-service-funds">transfer of funds from another employer</a>, you can use these funds to pay for your apprenticeships.
			</p>

			<p>
				You will receive your funds and pay for your apprenticeships using the apprenticeship service.
