		<p>
			You told us your annual paybill is less than £3 million, so you won't have to pay the apprenticeship levy.
		</p>

		<p>
			This means that you will only have to pay 10% towards the cost of apprenticeship training and the government will pay the rest.
		</p>

		<p>
			Additional incentives may also be available:
